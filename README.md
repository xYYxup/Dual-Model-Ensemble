# DeepFake Detection Using Dual-Model Ensemble Approach by Group Winkingüòâ

## Overview

In the digital age, the proliferation of DeepFake technology poses significant challenges to media authenticity and public trust. To address this issue, we have developed an AI-centric solution that leverages deep learning techniques to detect facial DeepFake content. Our approach integrates methodologies from two renowned frameworks‚Äî[DeepfakeBench](https://github.com/SCLBD/DeepfakeBench) and [MultiModal-DeepFake](https://github.com/rshaojimmy/MultiModal-DeepFake)‚Äîand employs a secondary screening mechanism to enhance detection accuracy.

## Features

- **Dual-Model Ensemble**: Combines the strengths of two distinct DeepFake detection models to improve robustness and accuracy.
- **Secondary Screening**: Utilizes a custom BinaryFusion neural network to re-evaluate and optimize the classification results from the ensemble models.
- **CSV-Based Workflow**: Ensures efficient data processing through seamless integration and handling of model outputs via CSV files.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Utilize the [FaceForensics++](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics) dataset, a comprehensive collection of real and manipulated facial videos, for training and evaluation.
2. **Model Integration**:
   - **DeepfakeBench**: Implement state-of-the-art detection methods from DeepfakeBench, analyzing facial features and inconsistencies.
   - **MultiModal-DeepFake**: Employ multimodal detection techniques from MultiModal-DeepFake, assessing both visual and audio cues to identify DeepFakes.
3. **Secondary Screening with BinaryFusion**:
   - **Input**: Compile classification results from both models into a CSV file.
   - **BinaryFusion Network**: Apply a neural network to process the combined model outputs, conducting a secondary evaluation to enhance final classification accuracy.

## Usage

1. **Run Detection Models**:

   - Execute the detection scripts from DeepfakeBench and MultiModal-DeepFake to generate classification results. Ensure the outputs are saved in CSV format.

2. **Secondary Screening**:

   - Process the combined CSV results using the BinaryFusion network:

     ```bash
     python binary_fusion.py --input_csv combined_results.csv --output_csv final_predictions.csv
     ```

3. **Evaluate Results**:

   - Assess the performance of the ensemble approach using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
